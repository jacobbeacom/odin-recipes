This project is intended to put into practice the HTML concepts that I have learned so far.
Skills I have demonstrated during this project include: Creating boilerplate html pages using the ! element at the top of a new html document, creating links using anchor elements, creating ordered and unordered lists using oi and ul elements, creating appropriate file structures to organize projects, creating and using appropriate headers to better organize content on a page, and finally: adding images from an outside source to my pages.
